  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Christmas is known as the birth of Jesus. It is the time when we celebrate for the son of God. Santa is the most iconic character of this holiday.</p>
  <h2>My Traditions</h2>
  <p>During Christmas time, my family and I often decorate our tree. We also have nifty treats like cookies and hot chocolate sometimes. We also like listening to Christmas music and watching funny Christmas movies!</p>
